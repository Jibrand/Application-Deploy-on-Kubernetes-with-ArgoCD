## Architecture Diagram

![3-Tier Application Deployment Diagram](./image.png)

This project demonstrates the deployment of a **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** application on a Kubernetes cluster using GitOps principles with **ArgoCD**. It focuses on automating deployment, scaling, and management of a cloud-native application while leveraging the power of Kubernetes and GitOps.

## Overview

GitOps is a modern way of managing infrastructure and applications declaratively using Git as the single source of truth. With ArgoCD, changes pushed to the Git repository automatically synchronize with the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring a consistent and reliable deployment process.
